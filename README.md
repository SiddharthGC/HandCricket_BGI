# HandCricket_BGI
Siddharth Chandrasekar, 2017

A turn-based cricket game based on the rock-paper-scissors ripoff we all loved growing up (in India). Built using C++ and the WinBGI
graphics.h library.

To run the game, you'll need to make sure that you have the WinBGI library installed. I've used a lot of Windows specific system functions
in C++, so this game will only work on Windows computers.

All the music tracks in the game are completely royalty free and all the sources have been mentioned in the game's credits.

Just a little note - I built this for a Game Programming course I did in my second year of college, and I was the only one in the 
class of around 70 students to get a perfect 10 grade for the course (Doesn't really matter now, but it made me happy at the time :-P).

Please do not copy my work. If you want to use it for reference, please make sure to cite it in your list of references. I'll know if 
you've used my code, so don't try it.
