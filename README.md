# HandCricket_BGI
Siddharth Chandrasekar, 2017

A turn-based cricket game based on the rock-paper-scissors ripoff we all loved growing up (in India). Built using C++ and the WinBGI
graphics.h library.

To run the game, first use WinRAR or any other archiving software to extract all of the data files. You'll need to place the ".cpp" file and the ".h" file just outside of the data files folder before compiling. Also, you'll need to make sure that you have the WinBGI library installed. I've used a lot of Windows specific system functions in C++, so this game will only work on Windows computers.

All the music tracks in the game are completely royalty free and all the sources have been mentioned in the game's credits.
